# rtl\_433\_stats
Catalog and analyze transmissions from devices recorded in rtl_433 JSON logs

## Function
`rtl_433_stats` catalogs and characterizes ISM-band devices in your neighborhood using data from the JSON log file generated by `rtl_433`.  It processes rtl\_433 JSON log files to:

* read the recorded packet information from the log file(s),
* catalog all devices recorded in the log(s),
* count the packets and consolidate redundant packets into individual transmissions, 
* summarize the statistics about packet signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and radio frequencies (Freq), the gap times between transmissions (ITGT), and the packets per transmission (PPT). 
  
Sample output looks like this:

## Use

Issue the command `rtl_433_stats -i <JSON filename>` to generate the report.  Note that the input file specification may include wildcards and/or compressed files (.gz or .bz2).  Use `-i` with no file specification for stdin.  

Issue the command `rtl_433_stats -h` to see command-line options:

```
usage: rtl_433_stats [-h] [-i [FILE ...]] [-o {SNR,ITGT,Freq,PPT} [{SNR,ITGT,Freq,PPT} ...]] [-x NOISE] [-w WINDOW] [-T] [-v]

	Analyze rtl_433 JSON logs to catalog the devices seen and to characterize
	statistically their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), times between
	transmissions (ITGT),tradio frequency (Freq), and packets per transmission (PPT).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i [FILE ...], --input [FILE ...]
                        Path to JSON log files to read in; can be .gz; can be wildcard; blank if <stdin>
  -o {SNR,ITGT,Freq,PPT} [{SNR,ITGT,Freq,PPT} ...], --omit {SNR,ITGT,Freq,PPT} [{SNR,ITGT,Freq,PPT} ...]
  -x NOISE, --exclude_noise NOISE
                        Exclude device records with fewer than 'NOISE' packets seen
  -w WINDOW, --xmt_window WINDOW
                        Max time in sec for a packet group to be considered as one transmission (default: None)
  -T, --include_TPMS    include tire pressure monitors in catalog (default: False)
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

```
In practice and for log files recorded over long periods, the log file may contain records for devices seen only sporadically: tire pressure monitor systems, security systems, automobile remotes, etc. These may make the report long and difficult to read.  Some options help customize the reports:

*  By default, tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are excluded from reports: use `-T` to _include_ them.
*  All other devices recorded in the log file(s) are included in the report by default.  Use the `-x n` option to exclude from the report any device with less than `n` packets in the logs (typically n=10 to 100 seem to be most useful).
*  The default report with all four characteristics is fairly wide.  It can be narrowed by omitting one or more of the characteristics with the `-o` option followed by `SNR`, `ITGT`, `Freq`, and/or `PPT` to specify which reports to omit.
*  By default, packets broadcast by a single device within a 2-second window are considered to be one transmission.  The `-w n` option, n in seconds, can be used to change that window, affecting the ITGT and PPT reports. 

If you've configured `logrotate` to compress and archive your `rtl_433` log files, you can process the .gz log files directly with the file specification to `rtl_433_stats`, and you can select just a set of files with wildcards.  For example, specify `-i /var/log/rtl_433/rtl_433.json-202303*.gz` to generate a report for just March, 2023.

## Operational Details

`rtl_433_stats` reads the JSON log file created by rtl\_433 (recommend to stop rtl_433 so that the JSON log file is closed for processing). The observed devices, as recorded in the JSON file in temporal order, are cataloged in alphabetical order in a summary table along with a count of the number of packets and de-duplicated transmissions seen for that device and with basic statistics for that device:

* count of samples,
* mean, 
* std deviation, 
* min value seen, and 
* max value seen

for these device characteristics:

* signal-to-noise ratio over all packets (SNR),
* inter-transmission gap times (ITGT): the time between successive transmissions by that device,
* radio frequency of transmissions (Freq) over all packets from that device,
* the number of packets per transmission (PPT).

A command-line option allows the de-selection of any or all of these statistics reports (default is to report all four).

A device "transmission" represents one observation but may contain 1 to 6 or more "packets", and transmissions are frequently initiated by remote sensor devices at approximately 15-second, 30-second, or 60-second intervals.  These are simplex communication devices -- the remote device sends data and receives no acknowledgement from the receiver that it has received the data.  In high-traffic neighborhoods, the signals from the various devices may interfere with each other.  Sending redundant packets increases the probability that a receiving device will successfully receive at least one packet in the transmission.

`rtl_433_stats` assumes that packets from the same device within a default setting of 2 seconds of each other were repeated for reliability and represent one transmission.  Override that 2-second window with the `-w n` option. 

SNR and frequency data are averaged over all packets; transmission gap times and packets per transmission are averaged over transmissions (grouped packets).

The key string for cataloging a device and labeling device in the report lines is the concatenation of the JSON 'model'/'channel'/'id' fields from the received data record.

`rtl_433_stats` tracks packet times _per device_ so that data for transmissions from different devices are separated and tranmission statistics for individual devices are more reliable in high-traffic areas.

## Installation
1. Use git to clone the distribution from Github, [https://github.com/hdtodd/rtl\_433\_stats](https://github.com/hdtodd/rtl_433_stats)  
2. Connect to the download directory
3. Type `python3 rtl_433_stats -i xaa.json` and compare its output with the file `xaa-output.rpt` to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

After verifying that `rtl_433_stats`is functioning correctly with test data, you may want to configure your `rtl_433` config file to record data from your own RTL_SDR dongle.  For example, add something like the following to your `rtl_433.conf` file:
```
output json:/var/log/rtl_433/rtl_433.json
```
(and create and assign ownership to /var/log/rtl\_433/ if necessary) and then restart rtl\_433.

## Known Issues

The first packet from a device during a transmission interval (individually or as the first in a transmission packet) may have a distorted SNR because of a high auto-gain on the receiving RTL\_SDR dongle.  Some devices issue just one packet per transmission and others issue 3-6.  No fix anticipated.

## Other Tools

The `tools` directory contains two Python scripts that may be useful for extracting records from the JSON log files for more detailed analysis:

*  `rtl_xtract_json` extracts from a JSON log file all records for one or more specific devices into a separate file.  Devices are identified by the "model/channel/id" keyword identifier in the `rtl_433_stats` report.
*  `rtl_json_csv` extracts from a JSON log file and into CSV format the values of fields specified on the command line.  The output is labeled with the "model/channel/id" identifier.  A header line identifying the extracted fields prefaces the data to allow easy importing into spreadsheet programs.

A reduced-functionality version of `rtl_433_stats` is available as a c-language version in the directory `c-version` as the program `snr`.  That program analyzes only signal-to-noise ratios and does not have the options for selecting records to be processed, but it may be useful in some circumstances (and is much faster in execution).
